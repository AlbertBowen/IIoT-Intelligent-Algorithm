### 2.2 Algorithm Details

#### 2.2.1 Predictive Maintenance
The predictive maintenance algorithm uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures before they occur. The algorithm is trained on historical sensor data to identify patterns and correlations between sensor readings and equipment failures. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to predict when a piece of equipment is likely to fail based on real-time sensor data.

#### 2.2.2 Anomaly Detection
The anomaly detection algorithm uses statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify abnormal patterns in sensor data. The algorithm can be used to detect equipment faults, security breaches, or other anomalies that may be indicative of a larger issue. By detecting these anomalies early, the algorithm can help prevent more serious problems from occurring.

#### 2.2.3 Energy Optimization
The energy optimization algorithm uses mathematical optimization techniques to minimize energy usage in IIoT systems. The algorithm takes into account a variety of factors, including energy costs, equipment efficiency, and environmental factors, to determine the optimal energy usage for a given system. By optimizing energy usage, the algorithm can reduce costs and improve sustainability.

#### 2.2.4 Data Filtering
The data filtering algorithm uses signal processing techniques to filter out noise and other irrelevant data from sensor readings. By removing this noise, the algorithm can improve the accuracy of data analysis and prediction. The algorithm can be used in conjunction with other algorithms to improve their performance.
